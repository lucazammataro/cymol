# Cymol
A Research and Educational Project on Classical Molecular Dynamics

Developed by Luca Zammataro, Copyright (C) 2024

Cymol is an educational and research-oriented project designed to explore classical molecular dynamics using modern programming paradigms. Inspired by Dennis C. Rapaport's seminal textbook, "The Art of Molecular Dynamics," this project implements some examples from the book. Named "Cymol" to reflect its use of Cython, this project aims to demonstrate how Cython can produce efficient, stable, and surprisingly fast code. Join us as we step-by-step uncover the impressive capabilities of Cython in molecular dynamics simulations.

## Overview

Cymol is a dynamic educational and research project aimed at exploring classical molecular dynamics through modern programming paradigms. This initiative is inspired by the seminal work "The Art of Molecular Dynamics" by Dennis C. Rapaport, with several examples initially implemented in C.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of Cymol is not just to reimplement existing algorithms, but to enhance them using Cython, demonstrating the power of this language in achieving highly efficient, stable, and fast computational solutions. This project serves as a practical guide to understanding the intricacies of molecular dynamics simulations and the optimization capabilities of Cython.

## Why Cython?

Cython offers a unique blend of simplicity and power, providing the ease of Python with the capability to achieve performance close to C languages. Through Cymol, we aim to showcase:
- **Efficiency:** How Cython can handle computationally intensive tasks.
- **Stability:** Ensuring robust simulations that are reliable and reproducible.
- **Speed:** Achieving remarkable execution times that rival traditional C-based implementations.

## Getting Started

To get involved with Cymol or try out the simulations:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and Cython installed.
3. Follow the setup instructions in our documentation to start running your own simulations.

## Contribution
