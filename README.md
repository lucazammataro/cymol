Cymol: A Research and Educational Project on Classical Molecular Dynamics
<img src="/images/cymol_main.JPG" alt="logo" style="display:block; margin:auto;">

Cymol is an educational and research-oriented project designed to explore classical molecular dynamics using modern programming paradigms. Inspired by Dennis C. Rapaport's seminal textbook, "The Art of Molecular Dynamics," this project implements some examples from the book, transitioning from C to Python. Named "Cymol" to reflect its use of Cython, this project aims to demonstrate how Cython can produce efficient, stable, and surprisingly fast code. Join us as we step-by-step uncover the impressive capabilities of Cython in molecular dynamics simulations.
